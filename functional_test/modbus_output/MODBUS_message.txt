### Additional Information (TXT):

1. **Length Field Dependency**: The "Length" field in the MBAP header specifies the number of bytes following it, including the Unit Identifier and the data fields. This means the Length field is the sum of the Unit Identifier length (1 byte) and the length of the Data field.

2. **Function Codes**: The MODBUS protocol uses various function codes to specify the action to be performed. Examples include:
   - 0x01: Read Coils
   - 0x02: Read Discrete Inputs
   - 0x03: Read Holding Registers
   - 0x04: Read Input Registers
   - 0x05: Write Single Coil
   - 0x06: Write Single Register
   - 0x0F: Write Multiple Coils
   - 0x10: Write Multiple Registers

3. **Unit Identifier**: The Unit Identifier is used for routing purposes when addressing a device on a MODBUS+ or MODBUS serial line sub-network. For MODBUS/TCP, it typically uses the value 255 (0xFF) when communicating directly to a MODBUS/TCP device.

4. **Data Field**: The Data field format and length depend on the function code and the specific request being made. For example, reading coils or registers will have different data field requirements compared to writing them.

This JSON and additional information capture the essential elements needed to construct MODBUS request messages for fuzz testing or other purposes.

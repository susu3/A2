### Explanation:
1. **IDLE**: The initial state where the system is waiting to establish a connection.
2. **CONNECTED**: Represents the state when a connection is established.
3. **WAITING_FOR_REQUEST**: The state where the server waits for incoming requests.
4. **PROCESSING_REQUEST**: Upon receiving a request, the server validates and processes it.
5. **SENDING_RESPONSE**: After processing, the server sends a response back to the client.
6. **DISCONNECTED**: Represents the state when the connection is terminated due to timeout or error.
7. **Transitions**:
   - `Connect`: Transition from IDLE to CONNECTED when a connection is established.
   - `ReceiveRequest`: Transition from CONNECTED to WAITING_FOR_REQUEST when a request is received.
   - `ValidateRequest`: Transition from WAITING_FOR_REQUEST to PROCESSING_REQUEST when a request is being validated.
   - `ProcessRequest`: Transition from PROCESSING_REQUEST to SENDING_RESPONSE when a request is processed.
   - `SendResponse`: Transition from SENDING_RESPONSE back to WAITING_FOR_REQUEST after sending a response.
   - `Timeout`: Transition from WAITING_FOR_REQUEST to DISCONNECTED if a timeout occurs.
   - `Error`: Transition from PROCESSING_REQUEST or SENDING_RESPONSE to DISCONNECTED if an error occurs.

This state machine provides a simplified view of the MODBUS protocol handling process, focusing on the core states and transitions involved in processing requests and maintaining connections.

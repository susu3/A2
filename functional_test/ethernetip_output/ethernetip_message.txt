### TXT Output

The following important information that cannot be organized in JSON format is detailed in the accompanying text file:

```
1. The value of the field "Length" in the encapsulation header is the sum of the length of all the following fields, plus the size of the header itself.

2. The "Session Handle" is generated by the target during the RegisterSession command and must be included in all subsequent encapsulated packets sent to that target.

3. The "Status" field in requests must always be set to 0, while it provides feedback in replies indicating success (0) or various error codes.

4. The "Command" field specifies the type of request being made, and different commands have specific requirements regarding the fields that follow.

5. The "Unused Data" field in the NOP command is allowed to be of variable length, but it is ignored by the receiver.

6. The encapsulated packet formats for SendRRData and SendUnitData include a field for the encapsulated protocol packet, which is structured according to the Common Packet Format.
